Common_Symbols.txt   No more searching for the degree symbol or that Greek letter in your equation. Simple, unformatted symbols that engineers commonly need. Save this file and copy-paste the symbol you need. Most word processing programs will auto-format the unformatted symbol to match the existing text.

ScheduleMatchingSystem_Template.xlsx   Trying to find a time to meet? Easily indicate each person's availability through red-yellow-green on an intuitive spreadsheet. Tip: put this in a file sharing and editing system, and let each person set their availability. Compare by simply looking at the color-coded columns for each date and time.

WeeklyScheduleTemplate_Printable.xlsx   Need a weekly planner? Want to avoid cumbersome, privacy-invading, or subscription-fee calendar systems? This simple but organized spreadsheet is a weekly planning page that can be filled out in any spreadsheet editor and be printed on standard letter paper, or can be printed and then filled by hand.
